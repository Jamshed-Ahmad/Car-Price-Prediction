# 🚗💰 Car Price Prediction: Unlock the Secrets of Car Valuation with AI! 💡

## 🔍 Project Overview <br>
This project harnesses the power of Machine Learning to predict car prices with high accuracy using key factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, and more. Whether you’re building a car marketplace or exploring the intersection of AI and the automotive industry, this project is your gateway to understanding car valuation like never before!<br>

## 🔑 What Makes This Project Unique?
In this project, I’ve built an intelligent machine learning model that predicts car prices by analyzing real-world data and uncovering hidden patterns. Using techniques like feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model optimization, we train models that perform exceptionally well in predicting car prices.

## 📌 Key Features <br>
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding trends, patterns, and distributions 📊 <br>
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data 🛠 <br>
✅ Feature Selection – Choosing relevant features for optimal model performance 🏗 <br>
✅ Model Comparison – Evaluating Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models 🔄 <br>
✅ Best Model Selection – Random Forest Regressor performed the best with the highest accuracy 🎯 <br>
✅ Dynamic Feature Input – No predefined lists; values are picked directly from the dataset 🏷 <br>
✅ Gradio-Based Web Interface – User-friendly web app for real-time price prediction 💻 <br>

## 📂 Dataset & Features <br>
The dataset contains various attributes affecting Car prices, including: <br>
| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------| 
symboling  | Risk level of the car (used by insurance) <br>
fueltype |  Type of fuel (gas, diesel, electric) <br>
aspiration | Induction system (turbocharged or naturally aspirated) <br>
doornumber |  Number of doors (2 or 4) <br>
Price | Target variable – Price of the car ₹ 💰 <br>

## 📊 Model Performance & Accuracy <br>
| Model | Accuracy (R² Score) |
|-------|---------------------|
Linear Regression | 76.5% <br>
Decision Tree | 86.2% <br>
Random Forest | 92.7% ✅ (Best Model) 

🔹 Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy (92.7%), making it the optimal choice for predictions. <br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Project <br>
### 1️⃣ Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to:
   - Perform data preprocessing and EDA.
   - Train and evaluate different regression models.
   - Compare accuracy metrics.

 ### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies 
 pip install `-r requirements.txt`. 

### 3️⃣ Run the Gradio App 
`python app.py`. <br>
or, if using Jupyter Notebook: <br>
`!gradio app.py`. 

The Gradio interface will launch in your browser, allowing you to predict house prices dynamically. 

###🌟 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced ensemble models 🏆.
🔹 Integrate real-time market trends 📈.
🔹 Deploy as a full-fledged web application 🌐.
